## Why should anarchists learn to fly FPV drones?
Anarchists should learn FPV flying for a couple reasons:

### Electronics and Data Transmission Knowledge
Firstly, learning about how an FPV drone is built can teach you about handling electronics and soldering. Learning how to solder can help with more than just electronics. Soldering can be used by makers, jewelers, fixer-uppers, plumbers, musicians, 
and metalworking. You can also learn about radio protocols, which can help for communication. Communicating through radio frequencies can be helpful for people who don't have access to a monthly subscription cellular plan or who can't afford the 
costs associated with a phone which can be upwards of thousands of dollars when all is said and done. On top of soldering and radio knowledge, you'll gain understanding about electrical engineering as well as video transmission. Both are helpful in
their own ways and can be applied to many other things.

### DIYing Everything
Learning about the materials associated with FPV drones and how they react to impacts is very helpful for people who may have to fix things sturdily aside from their drone(s). Knowing how materials like plastics, carbon fiber, and metals react to 
hitting or getting hit by a tree can translate into many other DIY projects and will help you create sturdy fixes to problems. FPV might require you to make fixes for things on the fly (pun intended) and that's a good way to practice for when 
something goes wrong outside of your goggles.

## Simulators 
The starting point for learning FPV flying is a simulator. There are many available for different platforms, and so long as you choose one with good reviews like LiftOff or the free option FPV.Skydive, you should be off to a good start. To get the 
best grasp on flying FPV in a simulator you will need a radio, which doesn't have to be expensive, but if you can afford one that will allow you to fly a physical drone efficiently and professionally like a RadioMaster Boxer, TX12, or Pocket, you'll be well off. If you can avoid using a console controller that is for the best, however my first controller is an old gamepad with some fpy sticks glued on. 

*Gamepads will not give the full experience with flying FPV as the throttle doesn't snap to the bottom of the gimbal. In gamepads the throttle stick snaps to the middle of the controller which can be an issue for translating to a real FPV radio.*
*An Upgrade to your simulator experience could be a pair of FPV goggles which are generally more expensive for the more capable ones but can hover around $80-$100 for the simpler ones like from BetaFPV.
